\section{Overview}

Human monitoring is therefore becoming
increasingly expensive and ineffective as the torrent of video data
increases. For instance, in a CCTV monitoring room (see
Figure \ref{fig:monitoring}), security operators are required to
monitor 24 hours a day and be ready to take action when an alarm
occurs.
